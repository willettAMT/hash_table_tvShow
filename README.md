<p>Draft functions are in place.... still need to write methods for my Show class</br>
Will continue to work on it this weekend.</p>

<p>This is almost finished. I'm getting better at debugging :) 
</br> Will need to clean up the client interface and I think I still need to implement Task 4 (adding new tv shows)
</br>Otherwise, no leaks, no problems. LETS GO </p>

<p><i>Menu Created. Found a bug</i>
</br>If you try to delete the same name twice, it seg faults. Figure this out. Also implement the Add Show functionality.</p>

## 2/20/24

<p><i>Fixed it all!!</i>Add Show functionality implemented in the menu. Stick a fork in this thing cuz IT'S DONE</p>
